# Timetable Together

Timetable Together is a collaborative scheduling web application for students and others alike.

With Timetable Together, you can create a timetable by adding events and choosing the right schedules, then share with your friends by having them follow you. Users who follow you can see your current timetable as you update it!

There are also other features, such as:

- User events: Create your own events for CCAs, friend groups and other purposes!
- Notes: Add notes to the calendar; optionally send them to your friends!
- Export: Export your timetable to apps like Google Calendar for convenience!
